# BCG-GenAI
Developing an AI-powered chatbot that analyzes financial documents. This is a cutting-edge project at the intersection of finance and generative AI (GenAI), a growing area of interest and investment at BCG.

This project has been created to simulate the responsibilities of a Jr. Data Scientist at Boston Consulting Group (BCG).
Your goal:
1) Your primary objective is to extract and analyze key financial data from the client's 10-K and 10-Q documents. This involves understanding financial statements, identifying significant trends, and preparing data for AI-driven applications.
2) Following the data analysis, you will develop an AI-powered financial chatbot. This chatbot must be capable of analyzing financial data and providing insights that effectively communicate complex financial information in an interactive and user-friendly manner.
3) Throughout the project, your focus will not only be on the technical execution but also on how these AI-driven insights can be leveraged in a consulting context to provide strategic recommendations and solutions to clients.
