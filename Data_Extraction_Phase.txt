Now that we have compiled the past 3-years worth of 10-K filings data from the EDGAR database of SEC,
we are tasked with the extraction of the following financial figures:
1) Total Revenue.
2) Net Income.
3) Total Assets.
4) Total Liabilities.
5) Cash Flow from Operating Activities.

A brute force and naive approach would be to manually parse the documents and report the findings in a Excel Worksheet.
However, being equipped with the knowledge of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and BeautifulSoup (bs4),
we shall approach the solution by building a Python script for the same.
